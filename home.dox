	Welcome to the Cobalt wiki.\n
	Cobalt is a 3D graphics engine developed by students for fun and learning.\n
	It is currently in early development.\n
	This wiki's primary goal is to give the developers a better overview over the project.\n
	The source code is not yet open for public, so it is basically pointless for me to write anything here,\n but I will do it anyway...\n
